      Starting to collect links for my various projects. This will also be a
      place to play with vanilla css since there's no framework here. It's a
      single HTML page.

    <p>
      First things first: I'm on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIdOfAlan">Twitter</a> a lot and
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theidofalan">Twitch</a> occasionally. I've
      got accounts on other social networks, but those are the ones I use
      regularaly.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that out of the way, here's the list of my projects. (I'm
      increasingly going with the idea of using sub-domains as the grounds for
      digital gardens. So, this is my domain garden, if you will.)

        This is a little project I built for myself so that when I've got a some
        time to watch a tech video during lunch I don't have to worry about
        finding one. This just plays a random one for me. Still have a bunch of
        features to add to this, but the basic functionality is nice.
