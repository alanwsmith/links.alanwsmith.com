          tell the story of a digital garden before we get to those:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A New Idea</h3>

      <p>
        I first heard about digital gardens on the wonderful
        <a href="https://www.partycorgi.com/">Party Corgi Network</a>. That lead
        me to these posts by
        <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton</a>
        and <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel Hooks</a> which
        explain the concept nicely. Here's a brief snippet from Maggie
        Appleton's piece:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse
        chronological order, these sites act more like free form,
        work-in-progress wikis.
      </blockquote>

      <p>That idea stuck a chord.</p>

      <p>
        I haven't been so excited about playing on the web since the '90s. I
        switched my site over from software designed to make a blog to a some
        that provides more freedom to move and experiment. I've been playing
        with the layout, design, and content ever since.
      </p>

      <p>But, I was feeling resistance.</p>

      <h3>Friction</h3>

      <p>
        Whenever I wanted to play with an idea, I'd have to take the existing
        setup and structure into account. For example, consider the width of the
        page layouts. Every page on my site has the same width. It's defined in
        a single configuration template. To make something a different width,
        I'd have to rewire the site for multiple templates.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've got enough experience that that wouldn't be particularly hard. But,
        it would be work. And that work is friction. And that friction stops me.
      </p>

      <p>Or, it's better to say that it keeps me from getting started.</p>

      <p>
        When I have an idea, I want to play with it. Not work on the
        infrastructure that supports it.
      </p>

      <h3>Enter Dusty Domains</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://dusty.domains/">Dusty Domains</a> was a charity project
        (and genius marketing play) from Netlify at the end of 2021. The pitch
        was to dip into the developer community's vast collection of unused
        domains and actually publish something on them by the end of the year.
        Each completed site added $500 to a pool for coding related charities.
      </p>

      <p>
        That sounded great to me. So, I built
        <a href="https://jacktorrance.blog/">JackTorrance.blog</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I turned it around in three days and had an absolute blast doing it. I
        started with nothing more than the domain, an idea, and a deadline and
        turned into something I'm really proud of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something also clicked during the build. I realized I hadn't experienced
        any of that &quot;getting started&quot; friction I'd been running into
        with ideas for my site. The empty domain was a clean slate. No worrying
        about the width of pages. I could make them whatever size I wanted
        without hassle.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, it went way beyond that. The software for my main site had no
        bearing on what I used for the new domain. I could use the same
        framework, a completely different one, or roll back to vanilla HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you had said the words "domains are independent" to me, I would have
        responded, "umm, yes. and?" But, the implications never fully
        registered. I didn't grok it.
      </p>

      <p>Now, I do.</p>

      <h3>I have one domain</h3>

      <p>
        When you buy a domain name, the basic setup ends up giving you two. One
        that starts with &quot;www&quot; (e.g. &quot;www.alanwsmith.com&quot;)
        and one that doesn't have any preface (e.g. &quot;alanwsmith.com&quot;).
        You can serve a site off either of them. I've gone back and forth over
        the years, but, they can pretty much be considered the same thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also split things out when I needed to use another service for my
        site. For example, serving my site pages off
        &quot;www.alanwsmith.com&quot; and then using
        &quot;images.alanwsmith.com&quot; pointed to a CDN to serve images.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, that was really just powering the same site with a few different
        root URLs.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's been my mental model for two decades. A cohesive site that
        sometimes spans sub-domains for functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>Then, something happened</h3>

      <p>
        It was getting towards the end of the Dusty Domains and they hadn't hit
        their goal. I'd seen one of their inspiration domains called
        <a href="https://hawk.dance/">Hawk Dance</a>. It's a single page site
        with throw-back animation. I figured I could pull off something like
        that, but I didn't have another unused domain that fit the bill. So, I
        decided to throw something up on a sub-domain of my site and made
        <a href="https://hacking.alanwsmith.com/">hacking.alanwsmith.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Boom. $500 for charity.</p>

      <p>
        They were still short. So, I made
        <a href="https://areyoucurrentlyalive.alanwsmith.com/"
          >AreYouCurrentlyAlive.alanwsmith.com</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>$500 more.</p>

      <p>
        Both sites took about fifteen minutes to build and launch. I was
        plotting to do twenty more if they needed. And, that's when the bit
        flipped.
      </p>
      <p>I don't have one domain. I have infinite domains.</p>

      <p>Each one, a clean slate.</p>

      <h3>Infinite Space</h3>

      <p>Not gonna lie. I feel punch drunk thinking of the implications.</p>

      <p>
        The ability to spin up a new domain on a whim feels like a super-power.
        Firing one up to play with a new framework?
        <a href="https://nextjs-playground.alanwsmith.com/">No problem</a>.
        Spinning one up for every framework out there? I mean, they're infinite,
        so... <a href="https://every-framework.alanwsmith.com">why not</a>?
      </p>

      <p>
        How about playing around with site designs using a full copy of the
        content? Just throw some notes to the search engines telling them to
        ignore the sandbox and away we go.
      </p>

      <p>
        Need a playground to test out a CSS library?
        <a href="https://tailwind-playground.alanwsmith.com/">You got it</a>.
        What to practice your vanilla JavaScript? Just flip the switch
        <a href="https://javascript-playground.alanwsmith.com/">and get going</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>That's all well and good, but what about something less practical?</p>

      <p>
        Like, say, a domain for each letter of the alphabet with nothing but the
        corresponding letter on it...
      </p>

      <p>Fuck it. Let's go:</p>

      <h3>An Infinite Garden</h3>

      <p>
        The idea of the digital garden resonated with me the instant I heard it.
        I made moves towards it with the energy of the initial excitement, but
        that burned out. The subtle friction and resistance that comes from
        working within an existing site worn down the enthusiasm until it was
        gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fitting analogy is the trees of the black forest. They're so dense
        they prevent anything else from growing beneath them. Trying to do new
        work on an existing site is like that. It means fighting against the
        environment. Being bound by its constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, we're not bound to a single domain. Doomed to fight against its
        pressures until we give up, exhausted.
      </p>

      <p>We have space.</p>

      <p>We can grow.</p>

      <p>Our gardens are infinite.</p>

      <p>Let's see what we can do with them.</p>

      <div class="spacer">~ fin ~</div>

      <h4 id="my-digital-domain-garden">My Digital Domain Garden</h4>

      <p>
        Now, allow me to introduce my budding digital domain garden. I just
        started some of them so they're pretty sparse. But, that's what it's all
        about. More importantly, the joy of playing with them and seeing which
        ones draw my attention and grow is invigorating and recharging and
        everything working on your own projects should be.

          I never used to put stuff on GitHub. I've flipped that. My approach

          Photography used to be my thing. It's what I was known for long before
          I got into code. During the years of getting my ass kicked by mental
          health issues, it left me. It was gone so long I'&apos;d gotten used
          to the idea that it was gone forever. Now, it&apos;s back. This is
          where I&apos;m posting my stuff.
